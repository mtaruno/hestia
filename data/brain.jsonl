{"title": "Study gives insight — and advice — on picky eating in children", "full_text": {"content": "Much of picky eating may be related to negative thoughts and memories about certain foods, or eating in general. The more that you are upbeat and positive about eating, the more likely your child will be that way too. Here are some ideas on how to do that:\n\nHave family meals — and enjoy each other during them. Eating together puts the emphasis on the social aspect of eating, rather than the food itself, which can be helpful. It's most helpful if that social aspect is pleasant, so put aside the devices and use mealtimes as time to catch up with each other, tell funny stories and otherwise enjoy the time together.\nDon't force a child to eat. Encourage them to try new foods, but don't get into fights about it. And do not make them finish everything on their plate (the \"clean plate club\" my parents always encouraged us to be part of is not a good idea). The corollary to this, though, is that you should not let your child snack all day (or fill up on milk or juice); if possible, they should arrive at a meal hungry enough to want to eat.\nInvolve your child in meal planning and preparation. Look at recipes together; be willing to try new and different things. Take them shopping with you. If you have the ability to grow some foods or spices, have your child be involved in that, too.\n\nActionable Advice: Make Mealtimes Positive  Eat together as a family and enjoy conversation without screens.

{"title": "Engaging Cooperation Through Choices and Play", "full_text": {"content": "In How to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen, Faber and King emphasize the importance of engaging children’s cooperation by offering choices and incorporating playfulness into daily routines. Instead of issuing direct commands, they suggest providing limited choices to empower children and reduce resistance. For example, asking, “Would you like to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt today?” gives the child a sense of control while achieving the desired outcome. Additionally, turning tasks into playful activities, like saying, “Can you hop like a bunny to the bathroom?” can make routines more enjoyable and less confrontational.\n\nActionable Advice: When facing resistance during daily routines, offer your child a choice between two acceptable options to foster a sense of autonomy. Incorporate playful elements into tasks to make them more engaging. For instance, transform cleanup time into a game by challenging your child to see how quickly they can pick up toys.

This approach not only supports the child’s growth but also alleviates the constant pressure on parents to control every aspect of their child’s behavior.\n\nActionable Advice: Engage your child in setting household rules by discussing expectations and consequences together.

She advises parents not to blame themselves, as many picky eaters have siblings who eat well, indicating that the behavior is often innate. Parents should avoid giving up on introducing new foods; research suggests it may take 8 to 15 exposures before a child accepts a new food. Ensuring the child comes to the table hungry by spacing snacks and meals appropriately can increase willingness to try new foods. Setting limits around food in a calm, matter-of-fact tone, such as stating, “You need to eat a bit of this in order to have dessert,” can be effective. Establishing consistent mealtime routines and keeping the atmosphere positive helps children associate mealtime with pleasant experiences.\n\nActionable Advice: Introduce new foods multiple times without pressure, as acceptance may take several exposures.
