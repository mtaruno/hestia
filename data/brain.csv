They’re developing language and social skills, including sharing. They may want to try simple tasks on their own and will probably learn by trying new things and taking risks. Help your preschooler by adding the following age-appropriate discipline techniques to those above:

Use positive timeouts when your child needs to cool off. Timeouts should be no longer than one minute for each year of your child’s life. Do not give attention, but give your child comfort items to help him or her calm down.
Focus on what your child should do instead of what not to do.
Praise good behavior rather than punish misbehavior. Rewards are fine but not when they become more important to the child than the good behavior.
Establish rules, set clear limits and follow through if rules are broken. Natural and logical consequences are appropriate for breaking your rules.
Discourage tattling. Offer to listen while children talk through their problems and use their own problem-solving skills to work things out instead of having you solve problems for them. Help them develop their own skills in working through dilemmas or disagreements.

The more that you are upbeat and positive about eating, the more likely your child will be that way too. Here are some ideas on how to do that:

Have family meals — and enjoy each other during them. Eating together puts the emphasis on the social aspect of eating, rather than the food itself, which can be helpful. It's most helpful if that social aspect is pleasant, so put aside the devices and use mealtimes as time to catch up with each other, tell funny stories and otherwise enjoy the time together.
Don't force a child to eat. Encourage them to try new foods, but don't get into fights about it. And do not make them finish everything on their plate (the ""clean plate club"" my parents always encouraged us to be part of is not a good idea). The corollary to this, though, is that you should not let your child snack all day (or fill up on milk or juice); if possible, they should arrive at a meal hungry enough to want to eat.

There are many things you can consider doing so your children develop the skills and attitudes that will help them to avoid the pitfalls of being labeled “spoiled.” You can teach children important life skills that will set them on a course of appreciation, moderation, and responsibility.

Be the “Executive” in your Home

Set limits and say “no” when appropriate.

For example, “No, it doesn’t work for me to have Sarah sleep over tonight.”

Help them to delay gratification by not giving them everything they want.

For example, “No, we don’t have time to stop for ice cream tonight.”

Do not make things too easy for them by allowing them to tolerate frustration in appropriate doses.

For example, “I know that learning to tie your shoes is hard to do, but I also know you can do it. I can talk you through the steps as you try it one more time.”

Let them experience a moderate amount of disappointment and then teaching them how to deal with it.

For example, “It is disappointing that you weren’t invited to Billy’s party. Is there something else you want to plan for that night?”

Show them how to make amends when they have hurt someone.

For example, “You knocked down your brother’s tower that he worked all day to build. What can you do to help him feel better?”

Hold them accountable for their behavior.

For example, “Even though your teacher did not post the assignment on line, you are still responsible for finding out what your homework is.”",children personality,greedy children,"Set Clear Limits  Say “no” when necessary and appropriate, even if it's uncomfortable.

If your toddler's sleeping patterns are not affecting you or your family and you have strategies that work, then you may not have a sleep concern.

There are a few approaches you can try if you are concerned with your toddler’s sleeping, these include: parental presence, camping out, bedtime fading and responsive settling. It is important that the approach you choose is right for your family.
Once you notice your toddler attempting to climb out of their cot, it is time to move them to a bed. This is usually between 2 and 3½ years of age but can be as early as 18 months.

He introduces the concept of self-regulation, which involves identifying and reducing stressors across five domains: biological, emotional, cognitive, social, and prosocial. By understanding that behaviors often perceived as misbehavior are actually stress responses, parents can shift from a reactive to a reflective approach. This perspective encourages parents to first address their own stress levels, recognizing that self-care is not indulgent but essential. Implementing self-regulation strategies—such as ensuring adequate sleep, nutrition, and moments of calm—can help parents restore their energy and better support their children’s needs.

In Self-Reg, Dr. Stuart Shanker introduces a five-step process to help parents manage stress and prevent burnout:
	1.	Reframe the Behavior: Understand that challenging behaviors in both children and parents are often stress responses, not intentional misbehavior.
	2.	Recognize the Stressors: Identify stressors across five domains—biological, emotional, cognitive, social, and prosocial—that may be affecting you or your child.
	3.	Reduce the Stress: Develop strategies to minimize identified stressors, such as adjusting routines, creating calming environments, or setting realistic expectations.
	4.	Reflect: Enhance awareness of stress responses and their impact on behavior. Consider what strategies are effective and where adjustments are needed.
	5.	Restore Energy: Engage in activities that replenish your energy and promote well-being, such as adequate sleep, physical activity, or mindfulness practices.

By applying this process, parents can better manage their own stress, model effective self-regulation for their children, and create a more harmonious family environment.",Stress & Burnout,"Self-Regulation, Parental Stress Management, Emotional Awareness","Identify personal stressors across five domains; implement self-care routines to manage stress; reframe child behavior as stress responses; adopt reflective parenting practices.

4/30/2025 9:10:04,Podcast,Peaceful Parenting: Dealing with Tantrums ,https://blog.lovevery.com/podcast/peaceful-parenting-dealing-with-tantrums/ ,Responding to Hitting with Connection and Boundaries,"In the podcast episode “Peaceful Parenting: Dealing with Tantrums,” Dr. Laura Markham discusses strategies for handling situations where a toddler hits a parent during a tantrum. She emphasizes the importance of staying calm and not taking the behavior personally. Dr. Markham advises parents to set clear boundaries by gently holding the child’s hands and saying, “I won’t let you hit me,” conveying that while all feelings are acceptable, certain behaviors are not. She highlights the significance of connecting with the child by acknowledging their emotions, such as saying, “You’re feeling very upset right now.” This approach helps the child feel understood and supported, facilitating emotional regulation and reducing aggressive behaviors over time.",Tantrums,"Aggressive Behavior, Emotional Regulation, Parent-Child Connection","When your child attempts to hit during a tantrum, calmly and firmly hold their hands to prevent harm, stating, “I won’t let you hit.” Ensure both your safety and theirs. Once the child begins to calm, acknowledge their emotions by saying, “You’re feeling very upset right now.” After the episode, discuss alternative ways to express anger, like using words or taking deep breaths, reinforcing that while all feelings are valid, certain behaviors are not acceptable.",Any,"Empathic / Supportive, Reflective / Philosophical, Practical / Action-Oriented","The advice from Dr. Laura Markham on managing aggressive tantrums—particularly when a child hits—can be especially useful in scenarios where:

1. Parents Feel Overwhelmed by Physical Aggression

When a child resorts to hitting during a tantrum, it can be both physically painful and emotionally distressing for the parent. Dr. Markham emphasizes the importance of staying calm and setting clear boundaries, such as saying, “I won’t let you hit me,” to address the behavior without escalating the situation.

2. Children Struggle with Emotional Regulation

Some children have difficulty managing their emotions and may express frustration through physical means. The strategies discussed in the podcast, like validating the child’s feelings and providing a safe space for them to express emotions, can help these children learn healthier ways to cope

3. Parents Seek Non-Punitive Discipline Methods

For parents looking to move away from punitive measures and towards more empathetic parenting, Dr. Markham’s approach offers practical tools. By focusing on connection and understanding, parents can guide their children through difficult moments without resorting to punishment.

4. Cultural Emphasis on Emotional Expression

In cultures or families that value open emotional expression and prioritize emotional intelligence, these techniques align well with existing values. They support the development of empathy and self-awareness in children. 

5. Edge Cases Involving Public Tantrums

Handling tantrums in public settings adds another layer of complexity. Dr. Markham discusses strategies for managing public outbursts, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the child’s needs rather than public perception.

In all these scenarios, the key takeaway is the emphasis on connection, understanding, and teaching children to manage their emotions constructively. This approach not only addresses the immediate behavior but also contributes to the child’s long-term emotional development.","Afternoon (e.g., playtime, homework), Evening (e.g., family time, winding down)",Dr. Laura Markham,"Clinical Psychologist, Parenting Coach, Author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids"

She differentiates between rules and boundaries, emphasizing that while rules are expectations set by parents, boundaries are personal limits that protect one’s well-being. Collins suggests that parents model boundary-setting by expressing their own limits respectfully, teaching children to do the same. She provides practical examples, such as saying, “I need some quiet time right now,” to illustrate how parents can communicate their needs without guilt. This approach fosters mutual respect and helps children understand the importance of personal space and emotional health. ",Discipline & boundaries,"Emotional Regulation, Parent-Child Communication, Respectful Parenting","Parents are encouraged to model boundary-setting by clearly and calmly communicating their own needs and limits. For instance, stating, “I need a few minutes to finish this task, then I can help you,” teaches children to respect others’ time and space. This practice not only sets healthy boundaries but also equips children with the language and understanding to set their own boundaries in the future.",Any,"Adaptive / Culturally Sensitive, Empathic / Supportive, Practical / Action-Oriented","This advice is especially useful for parents who find themselves overstretched or feeling guilty for needing personal space, particularly in cultures where self-sacrifice in parenting is emphasized. It’s also well-suited for gentle or respectful parenting households that value emotional literacy. The strategy works well during transition periods (e.g., post-naptime, end of play) when children often test limits. Modeling boundary-setting helps prevent burnout and teaches children how to assert needs respectfully—an essential skill for both peer relationships and long-term emotional resilience.",,Stacey Collins,Parenting Educator and Host of the “3 in 30 Takeaways for Moms” Podcast

Instead of issuing direct commands, they suggest providing limited choices to empower children and reduce resistance. For example, asking, “Would you like to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt today?” gives the child a sense of control while achieving the desired outcome. Additionally, turning tasks into playful activities, like saying, “Can you hop like a bunny to the bathroom?” can make routines more enjoyable and less confrontational.",Communication & speech,"Cooperation, Choice-Making, Playful Engagement ","When facing resistance during daily routines, offer your child a choice between two acceptable options to foster a sense of autonomy.

She advises parents not to blame themselves, as many picky eaters have siblings who eat well, indicating that the behavior is often innate. Parents should avoid giving up on introducing new foods; research suggests it may take 8 to 15 exposures before a child accepts a new food. Ensuring the child comes to the table hungry by spacing snacks and meals appropriately can increase willingness to try new foods. Setting limits around food in a calm, matter-of-fact tone, such as stating, “You need to eat a bit of this in order to have dessert,” can be effective. Establishing consistent mealtime routines and keeping the atmosphere positive helps children associate mealtime with pleasant experiences.  ",Picky Eating / Eating Habits,"Mealtime Routines, Food Exposure, Parental Strategies","Introduce new foods multiple times without pressure, as acceptance may take several exposures.
